# Effective mobility in polycryatallice materials: grain boundaries
Script in matlab which calculate effective mobility in a policrystalline structure.

The calculations are based on the:
<div class="csl-entry">Kim, D. M., Khondker, A. N., Ahmed, S. S., &#38; Shah, R. R. (1984). Theory of conduction in polysilicon: Drift-diffusion approach in crystalline-amorphous-crystalline semiconductor system - Part I: Small signal theory. <i>IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices</i>, <i>31</i>(4), 480–493. https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1984.21554</div>

\
I used this script in publication:

<div class="csl-entry">Wiśniewski, K., &#38; Zabierowski, P. (2021). Diffusion transport over grain-boundary barriers as the origin of N1 deep level transient spectroscopy signal in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. <i>Thin Solid Films</i>, <i>721</i>, 138540. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsf.2021.138540</div>

The comments in the code are in Polish, if you want me to translate them, let me know.
